Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates financial plans for customers. They wanted to modernize and use the latest in software security.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Preforming a dependency check was a big part in my findings of some vulnerabilities. Having secure code is important to the security of the entire program. One attack could cause a lot of damage.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Starting out I struggled with getting the dependency check to run at all. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Having the ability to add input verification is a good skill to have to ensure someone doesn’t cause an error due to the wrong value for an input.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Running a dependency check is a good way to ensure you didn’t add more vulnerabilities that weren’t there before.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Oss index is helpful when it comes to knowing what each vulnerability means and how they could be effecting the system’s security.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them how I was able to pinpoint the vulnerabilities with the use of dependency checks as well as whether or not they can be addressed or not.
